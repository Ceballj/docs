## 2 Asking a Good Question {#ask-a-good-question}

If you ask a good question, the chance that it gets answered would be much bigger. Here are some tips for you:

* Search on Mendix Forum before you ask a question
  Before you ask your question directly, do a [search](mendix-forum#searching) to see whether it was already asked on the Mendix Forum. If it was asked, then you already get an answer.

* Give your question a good title
  Make the title descriptive and interesting. Make sure you include important keywords that can help others identify and understand your question. 

* Describe in detail
  Give all useful details that can help people answer your question. Consider the following:
  * What you want to achieve?
  * What happened?
  * How did it happen?
  * Did you try to solve it and if so, what did you do?
  * Are there any [error messages]() or [application logs](/developerportal/operate/logs)?
  * Did you read any documentation? Did it work? 
  
* Add screenshots
  If possible, use screenshots in your question, because they show people what is exactly happening on your screen.

* Include all relevant tags
  Add tags to your question. They can help people with interest in these areas see your questions faster.

* Do a final check before posting
Do a final check before you post your question. Pretend you are reading  it for the first time. Does it make sense? Did you include all important information? Is there a typo?
